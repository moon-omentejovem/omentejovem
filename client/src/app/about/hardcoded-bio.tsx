      Thales Machado, better known as omentejovem, creatively navigates between
      figurative and abstract realms, crafting vibrant, color-rich artworks that
      show a visual diary of his life experiences and emotions.
    </h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      Omentejovem hails from Rio de Janeiro (b. 2001), where his sketches were
      already brought to life by others before he himself realized he could
      become an artist. Born as Thales Machado, the Brazilian creator made a
      career for himself in web3 without any formal art school training. His
      work is a fusion of intuition and personal experiences, often oscillating
      between figurative and abstract styles. Reflecting his explorations of the
      world around him, omentejovem’s art is a visual diary documenting his
      feelings and life events. His pieces range from having clear
      representational elements to being completely open to interpretation,
      allowing the audience to bring their own perspectives and experiences to
      their understanding of his work. A distinct feature of his art is his use
      of color, which he continually evolves to add depth to his creations.
      Omentejovem blends the literal with the metaphorical, creating pieces that
      come alive as viewers find their meanings within them

    <h3 className="text-primary-50 text-2xl">
      &quot;I personally love it when someone sees something entirely different
      in my work than I did myself. Then the artwork really comes to life.&quot;

    <h3 className="text-2xl">The story of omentejovem (Thales Machado)</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Born in the state of{' '}
      <span className="text-primary-50">Rio de Janeiro</span>, artist Thales
      Machado vividly recalls a period a decade ago, when his drawings garnered
      particular attention. “My teacher and friends at school would examine my
      sketches and animate them with their interpretations of the lines and
      details,” he recalls. “Creating these compositions intuitively was
      enjoyable, but it became even more fascinating when others shared their
      perspectives, often seeing things in my work that I hadn’t noticed.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      “I remember then contemplating a career as an artist for the first time
      and wondering if I could sustain myself through art,” Machado reflects. At
      12, many preemptively dismissed his aspirations as impractical, cautioning
      him about the hardships. “They said it would be extremely difficult and I
      might struggle for basic needs,” he notes. Consequently, Machado shelved
      this dream, not giving it much consideration. “I went on with my life,
      hung out with friends and went to music concerts a lot, uncertain about my
      true passion.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In his mid-teens, Machado began dabbling in image design in Photoshop, but
      “just for fun.” However, this led him to create visuals for his musician
      and rapper friends. “I made cover arts and lyric videos for their social
      media, and this was basically the start of a career in design since I got
      asked to do work for others more and more,” he explains.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Machado discovered NFTs in late 2020, and that made a huge impact. By
      then, he had actually already grown quite disillusioned with the limited
      creative freedom he had. “I was designing for a song, for a person. I had
      ideas I liked, but they needed approval from others,” he recalls. Machado
      understood that NFTs could provide a way for him to freely create digital
      artworks, without the constraints of commissions.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      His introduction to NFTs and the crypto art community came through Etienne
      Crauss. As a longtime video gamer who created his own skins for
      first-person shooter (FPS) games, Machado easily grasped the concept of
      digital assets. “Etienne gave me some Ethereum to mint my first piece, and
      to my surprise, it sold for 0.4 ETH the next morning. That was equivalent
      to what I’d earn in a month, working tirelessly around the clock, and only
      if I was fortunate enough to have clients,” he recounts. “Suddenly,
      everything clicked. The process was straightforward yet groundbreaking.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Following this defining moment, Machado shifted his entire focus to the
      web3 domain, immersing himself in understanding the potential of NFTs for
      artists. He also began refining his artistic vision and aesthetics while
      improving his English skills. “I realized I needed to devote myself
      entirely to this space,” he explains. “It was my chance to create freely
      and earn a living from my art.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Things then quickly changed for Machado. “I soon managed to get my own
      computer for creating my work through the NFTs I sold,” he says, “and that
      made a world of difference.” Previously, Machado relied on his brother’s
      computer, situated in the family’s living room. “Working there was
      challenging; I had to use it at night or early dawn when it was available
      and quieter, away from the distractions of family and visitors.” Now, he
      could finally work whenever he wanted, during the times he felt inspired
      and didn’t have to wait to start creating.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Machado’s acceptance as an artist on SuperRare was the next milestone, one
      he almost hadn’t dared to dream about. “Then it was clear to me my life
      had changed,” he states. “But I also knew that I had to maintain momentum
      with my creativity and had to continue enhancing my aesthetic and vision,”
      he reflects. Determined not to squander this opportunity, Machado’s strong
      discipline and sense of responsibility propelled him towards a promising
      artistic career, at just 23.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Not having had formal art education and much exposure to the works of
      other artists, Machado has always relied on his intuition. Initially, the
      notion of being ‘an artist’ led him to believe he needed a distinct,
      recognizable style. “My early artworks were very structured. I didn’t
      think I could create something solely for its aesthetic value. I aimed for
      linearity and specific forms,” he explains. However, this approach quickly
      became burdensome, stifling his creativity and joy. “I returned to the
      method from my teenage years in class: drawing random lines, allowing
      myself freedom, and then discovering beauty in it. That reignited my
      excitement, and art-making became a more effortless process with a lot of
      output, which is how I think it also should be.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Initially, Machado used the pseudonym Talisma, a blend of his first name,
      Thales, and ‘talisman.’ However, he soon embraced the moniker omentejovem.
      “During a long, heavily under influenced, laughter-filled evening with
      friends, we realized how our young minds were guiding us that night,” he
      recounts. “We made spontaneous decisions, unshackled by rules or fear of
      the unknown. ‘Omentejovem,’ or ‘O Mente Jovem’ in Portuguese, translates
      to ‘The Young Mind.’ This resonated with me instantly and serves as a
      constant reminder to remain open and fearless in my creativity, and in
      life generally.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Omentejovem crafts small narratives that reflect his perception of the
      world. “Sometimes, I appreciate an artwork just for its appearance, but
      often, it symbolizes something significant to me, capturing a specific
      emotion or event.” His work acts as a visual diary, drawing inspiration
      from his life experiences and feelings. For example,{' '}
      <em>
        <a
          href="/_next/static/media/tdifo.ec478fa9.jpg"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          The Day I Found out I Can Do Anything
        </a>
      </em>{' '}
      is a direct reference to a moment of self-realization. “That day, I felt
      empowered with the belief that I could achieve anything. It’s just a
      matter of commitment, patience, and faith.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Machado’s belief extends beyond himself; to a higher power. He feels a
      divine presence that provides him with strength and resilience during
      challenging times. The piece{' '}
      <em>
        <a
          href="/_next/static/media/tdifg.aa846162.jpg"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          The Day I Felt God
        </a>
      </em>{' '}
      therefore also holds significant meaning for omentejovem. He shares: “I
      created it when I experienced a powerful energy. It felt like everything
      aligned, and I knew I had the capability to transform my life, as well as
      the lives of my family and friends,{' '}
      <span>
        as long as I just kept having attention to creating: combining my
        passion and putting in the effort for it.
      </span>
      ”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      An unmissable feature of omentejovem’s works is the{' '}
      <em>
        <span className="text-primary-50">vibrant use of colors</span>
      </em>
      . “Even though I receive compliments for my color choices, I feel like I’m
      just beginning to explore this aspect. Initially, I limited my palette to
      prevent indecision from the overwhelming possibilities,” he explains. Now,
      Machado is keen on expanding his color range to add more depth to his
      work. “I admire artists like Miro, whom I discovered quite late, and have
      always looked up to Kandinsky and Picasso. Their innovations have
      influenced my own creations, but my goal is to continually innovate and
      develop my own artistic language and expression.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Within that language, Machado fluidly alternates between figurative and
      abstract elements. “Some details in my works are deliberately
      representational: a person, an animal, an object, emerging from random
      lines. But at times, I’m not aiming to depict anything specific; I’m
      intrigued to see how my audience interprets various shapes,” he explains.
      “It’s always a blend for me. Sometimes, I want the origin of a piece to be
      clear, so I give it a descriptive title just like{' '}
      <em>The Day I Found out I Can Do Anything</em>,{' '}
      <em>The Day I Felt God</em>{' '}
      <span>
        and also <em>The Day I met you</em> for example
      </span>
      . Other times, I prefer everything to be open to interpretation, allowing
      abstraction to take the lead. I let viewers perceive the piece through
      their own experiences, beliefs, and opinions. It’s particularly rewarding
      when someone sees something in my work that I hadn’t envisioned. That’s
      when the art truly comes alive.”

    <br />

    <p>
      <em>Creative Workaholic</em> shows the start of omentejovem’s journey as
      an artist. “After my first NFT sale, I became obsessed with creations and
      thinking about the possibilities of making art. At dawn I found myself
      staring at and contemplating the concept of the moon, since I still worked
      at strange hours during that time to be able to use the computer in our
      family home.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In the upper left corner of the composition is the moon, a symbol of
      change and transition, rendered here in a contemplative state between
      wakefulness and dream. “My mind wandered off, seeing a desired future for
      me; one with my own room, my own computer, and then later my own home –
      and (co-)creating my own furniture for that house.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The moon’s crescent form, often associated with progression and the
      cyclical nature of time, mirrors the artist’s iterative process of
      creation and reflection. “I felt I had my own career and my own life in my
      hands; I felt I could literally shape it (read: through the lines and
      shapes on my digital creations) the way I wanted to.”
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      On the right side, a wheel-like form seems to serve as a grounding motif,
      like an emblem of the artist’s journey. It could symbolize the tools
      omentejovem used and the ‘vehicle’ propelling him forward in his artistic
      pursuit. This resonates with the artist’s account of working hard –
      through odd hours – and the determination to manifest his aspirations
      through art: a wheel in motion, charting a course towards a self-sculpted
      future.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The two dots down below are evocative of eyes and introduce a sentient
      aspect to the piece, implying a watchful presence over the artist’s
      trajectory. They suggest awareness, a conscious steering of one’s destiny,
      and a vigilant reflection on feedback and self-evaluation. “I believe my
      rapid progress in the space stems from not limiting myself, but being
      mindful of my actions and actively listening to others at the same time.”
      The eyes can also function as windows to an internal world, one where
      dreams are actively being shaped and not only passively hoped for.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The interplay of textures and patterns throughout the piece contributes to
      a sense of dynamism and complexity, reflecting the multifaceted nature of
      the omentejovem’s work. The image is not a static representation but a
      layered narrative of aspiration, effort, and creativity.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <em>Creative Workaholic</em> resonates with the idea that art can function
      both as a mirror and a map: reflecting the artist’s state at the time, and
      charting a path to the future they envision. In its entirety, the artwork
      is a visual articulation of the omentejovem’s ethos: to dream without
      bounds, to labor with intent, and to shape reality with the tools of his
      craft. The narrative woven through <em>Creative Workaholic</em> is one of
      personal agency and the potent role of art in carving out one’s space in
      the world.

    <p className="text-xl underline">Late Night Love</p>
    <br />

    <Image
      src={AboutImage2}
      alt="Omentejovem Artwork"
      width={500}
      height={300}
    />
    <br />

    <p>
      In <em>Late Night Love</em>, omentejovem tells a visual story of
      introspection. In the upper central part of the composition are the
      recurring motifs of ‘The Moon’ and ‘The Dot’, which the artist has imbued
      with philosophical significance, and which appear in many of his works.
      The moon, which can be seen as a symbol of the unconscious and a guide
      through the darkness (both as opposed to the sun), is rendered with a
      contemplative and huge presence (big and sketch-like in black and then
      very small but bright and with clear lines inside that bigger half-moon
      shape). The lunar element speaks to the cycles of creativity and
      reflection, a celestial body that is both witness and participant in the
      artist’s nocturnal dialogues with himself and his works.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      ‘The Dot’, as described by omentejovem, represents an individual
      singularity, a focal point of identity and personal significance amid the
      vast canvas of existence. It can be found in multiple places in this
      piece, but most significantly on the right side, ‘alone’ in the off-white.
      ‘The Dot’ serves as a reminder to maintain one’s core in a (fast-paced)
      changing world, like a nexus of self amidst the swirling cosmos of
      potential and distraction.
      <br />
      The interplay between the overarching presence of ‘The Moon’ and the
      grounding ‘The Dot’ creates a dichotomy within the artwork, symbolizing
      the balance between the vastness of the cosmos and the intimacy of
      individual existence. The dynamic between the two can be interpreted as a
      conversation about the macro and micro, the universal and the personal,
      the external world and the internal sphere.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In the context of omentejovem’s narrative, these symbols are not static;
      they are ever-evolving concepts that morph with each artistic iteration.
      They invite the viewer to contemplate their own place in the universe,
      their own ‘dots’, and how they interact with the larger forces at
      play—like the gravitational pull of the moon on the tides of human
      experience.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Down below there seems to be a big visual feast, as if figures are dancing
      in the moonlight. Among them, there’s one distinct character delineated in
      a contrasting hue and holding a heart-shaped balloon. Might this be an
      avatar for the artist? The balloon, an object of whimsy and ascent, might
      suggest the elevation of the artist’s aspirations and the lightness of
      dreams (The Moon) against the gravity of reality (The Dot). Combined, they
      speak of the artist’s love for his practice, a love that is not bound by
      the conventional hours but can easily flourish in the liberty of the
      night, hence the title ‘Late Night Love’.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <span>
        Besides one’s own thoughts and interpretations, for omentejovem the
        stand-out figure with the balloon was created by means of encapsulating
        the transient nature of a brief romance the artist experienced while
        being on a trip to São Paulo. The piece is set in the thrall of the
        city’s vibrant nightlife and the ephemeral connections it fosters. The
        balloon in the shape of a heart, the latter a symbol of love in its
        myriad forms, here represents the artist’s contemplation of both
        affection and at the same time solitude within the fleeting intimacy of
        a short-lived relationship.
      </span>
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In its entirety, this work speaks to the interconnectedness of the
      individual and the collective, the artist and the audience. It is a
      reflection on omentejovem’s journey and an open invitation to the viewer
      to engage themselves in an (inner) dialogue, echoing the very nature of
      art as a medium of communication and connection.
