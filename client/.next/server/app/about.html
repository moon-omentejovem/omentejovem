At 12, many preemptively dismissed his aspirations as impractical, cautioning him about the hardships. “They said it would be extremely difficult and I might struggle for basic needs,” he notes. Consequently, Machado shelved this dream, not giving it much consideration. “I went on with my life, hung out with friends and went to music concerts a lot, uncertain about my true passion.”</p><p>In his mid-teens, Machado began dabbling in image design in Photoshop, but “just for fun.” However, this led him to create visuals for his musician and rapper friends. “I made cover arts and lyric videos for their social media, and this was basically the start of a career in design since I got asked to do work for others more and more,” he explains.</p><p>Machado discovered NFTs in late 2020, and that made a huge impact. By then, he had actually already grown quite disillusioned with the limited creative freedom he had. “I was designing for a song, for a person. I had ideas I liked, but they needed approval from others,” he recalls. Machado understood that NFTs could provide a way for him to freely create digital artworks, without the constraints of commissions.</p><p>His introduction to NFTs and the crypto art community came through Etienne Crauss. As a longtime video gamer who created his own skins for first-person shooter (FPS) games, Machado easily grasped the concept of digital assets. “Etienne gave me some Ethereum to mint my first piece, and to my surprise, it sold for 0.4 ETH the next morning. That was equivalent to what I’d earn in a month, working tirelessly around the clock, and only if I was fortunate enough to have clients,” he recounts. “Suddenly, everything clicked. The process was straightforward yet groundbreaking.”</p><p>Following this defining moment, Machado shifted his entire focus to the web3 domain, immersing himself in understanding the potential of NFTs for artists. He also began refining his artistic vision and aesthetics while improving his English skills. “I realized I needed to devote myself entirely to this space,” he explains. “It was my chance to create freely and earn a living from my art.”</p><p>Things then quickly changed for Machado. “I soon managed to get my own computer for creating my work through the NFTs I sold,” he says, “and that made a world of difference.” Previously, Machado relied on his brother’s computer, situated in the family’s living room. “Working there was challenging; I had to use it at night or early dawn when it was available and quieter, away from the distractions of family and visitors.” Now, he could finally work whenever he wanted, during the times he felt inspired and didn’t have to wait to start creating.</p><p>Machado’s acceptance as an artist on SuperRare was the next milestone, one he almost hadn’t dared to dream about. “Then it was clear to me my life had changed,” he states. “But I also knew that I had to maintain momentum with my creativity and had to continue enhancing my aesthetic and vision,” he reflects. Determined not to squander this opportunity, Machado’s strong discipline and sense of responsibility propelled him towards a promising artistic career, at just 23.</p><p>Not having had formal art education and much exposure to the works of other artists, Machado has always relied on his intuition. Initially, the notion of being ‘an artist’ led him to believe he needed a distinct, recognizable style. “My early artworks were very structured. I didn’t think I could create something solely for its aesthetic value. I aimed for linearity and specific forms,” he explains. However, this approach quickly became burdensome, stifling his creativity and joy. “I returned to the method from my teenage years in class: drawing random lines, allowing myself freedom, and then discovering beauty in it. That reignited my excitement, and art-making became a more effortless process with a lot of output, which is how I think it also should be.”</p><p>Initially, Machado used the pseudonym Talisma, a blend of his first name, Thales, and ‘talisman.’ However, he soon embraced the moniker omentejovem. “During a long, heavily under influenced, laughter-filled evening with friends, we realized how our young minds were guiding us that night,” he recounts. “We made spontaneous decisions, unshackled by rules or fear of the unknown. ‘Omentejovem,’ or ‘O Mente Jovem’ in Portuguese, translates to ‘The Young Mind.’ This resonated with me instantly and serves as a constant reminder to remain open and fearless in my creativity, and in life generally.”</p><p>Omentejovem crafts small narratives that reflect his perception of the world. “Sometimes, I appreciate an artwork just for its appearance, but often, it symbolizes something significant to me, capturing a specific emotion or event.” His work acts as a visual diary, drawing inspiration from his life experiences and feelings. For example,<!-- --> <em><a href="https://media.omentejovem.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7_ThedayIfoundoutIcandoeverything_11zon-Personalizado.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Day I Found out I Can Do Anything</a></em> <!-- -->is a direct reference to a moment of self-realization. “That day, I felt empowered with the belief that I could achieve anything. It’s just a matter of commitment, patience, and faith.”</p><p>Machado’s belief extends beyond himself; to a higher power. He feels a divine presence that provides him with strength and resilience during challenging times. The piece<!-- --> <em><a href="https://media.omentejovem.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/9_the_day_i_felt_god_11zon-Personalizado.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Day I Felt God</a></em> <!-- -->therefore also holds significant meaning for omentejovem. He shares: “I created it when I experienced a powerful energy. It felt like everything aligned, and I knew I had the capability to transform my life, as well as the lives of my family and friends,<!-- --> <span>as long as I just kept having attention to creating: combining my passion and putting in the effort for it.</span>”</p><p>An unmissable feature of omentejovem’s works is the<!-- --> <a href="https://media.omentejovem.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/19_the_day_i_met_you_11zon-Personalizado.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vibrant use of colors</a>. “Even though I receive compliments for my color choices, I feel like I’m just beginning to explore this aspect. Initially, I limited my palette to prevent indecision from the overwhelming possibilities,” he explains. Now, Machado is keen on expanding his color range to add more depth to his work. “I admire artists like Miro, whom I discovered quite late, and have always looked up to Kandinsky and Picasso. Their innovations have influenced my own creations, but my goal is to continually innovate and develop my own artistic language and expression.”</p><p>Within that language, Machado fluidly alternates between figurative and abstract elements. “Some details in my works are deliberately representational: a person, an animal, an object, emerging from random lines. But at times, I’m not aiming to depict anything specific; I’m intrigued to see how my audience interprets various shapes,” he explains. “It’s always a blend for me. Sometimes, I want the origin of a piece to be clear, so I give it a descriptive title just like <em>The Day I Found out I Can Do Anything</em>, <em>The Day I Felt God</em> <span>and also <em>The Day I met you</em> for example</span>. Other times, I prefer everything to be open to interpretation, allowing abstraction to take the lead. I let viewers perceive the piece through their own experiences, beliefs, and opinions. It’s particularly rewarding when someone sees something in my work that I hadn’t envisioned. That’s when the art truly comes alive.”</p><h2>Featured works</h2><h3><a href="https://media.omentejovem.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_creative_workaholic_11zon-Personalizado.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Creative Workaholic</em></a></h3><p><em>Creative Workaholic</em> shows the start of omentejovem’s journey as an artist. “After my first NFT sale, I became obsessed with creations and thinking about the possibilities of making art. At dawn I found myself staring at and contemplating the concept of the moon, since I still worked at strange hours during that time to be able to use the computer in our family home.”</p><p>In the upper left corner of the composition is the moon, a symbol of change and transition, rendered here in a contemplative state between wakefulness and dream. “My mind wandered off, seeing a desired future for me; one with my own room, my own computer, and then later my own home – and (co-)creating my own furniture for that house.”</p><p>The moon’s crescent form, often associated with progression and the cyclical nature of time, mirrors the artist’s iterative process of creation and reflection. “I felt I had my own career and my own life in my hands; I felt I could literally shape it (read: through the lines and shapes on my digital creations) the way I wanted to.”</p><p>On the right side, a wheel-like form seems to serve as a grounding motif, like an emblem of the artist’s journey. It could symbolize the tools omentejovem used and the ‘vehicle’ propelling him forward in his artistic pursuit. This resonates with the artist’s account of working hard – through odd hours – and the determination to manifest his aspirations through art: a wheel in motion, charting a course towards a self-sculpted future.</p><p>The two dots down below are evocative of eyes and introduce a sentient aspect to the piece, implying a watchful presence over the artist’s trajectory. They suggest awareness, a conscious steering of one’s destiny, and a vigilant reflection on feedback and self-evaluation. “I believe my rapid progress in the space stems from not limiting myself, but being mindful of my actions and actively listening to others at the same time.” The eyes can also function as windows to an internal world, one where dreams are actively being shaped and not only passively hoped for.</p><p>The interplay of textures and patterns throughout the piece contributes to a sense of dynamism and complexity, reflecting the multifaceted nature of the omentejovem’s work. The image is not a static representation but a layered narrative of aspiration, effort, and creativity.</p><p><em>Creative Workaholic</em> resonates with the idea that art can function both as a mirror and a map: reflecting the artist’s state at the time, and charting a path to the future they envision. In its entirety, the artwork is a visual articulation of the omentejovem’s ethos: to dream without bounds, to labor with intent, and to shape reality with the tools of his craft. The narrative woven through <em>Creative Workaholic</em> is one of personal agency and the potent role of art in carving out one’s space in the world.</p><h3><a href="https://media.omentejovem.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/13_late-night-love_11zon-Personalizado.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Late Night Love</em></a></h3><p>In <em>Late Night Love</em>, omentejovem tells a visual story of introspection. In the upper central part of the composition are the recurring motifs of ‘The Moon’ and ‘The Dot’, which the artist has imbued with philosophical significance, and which appear in many of his works. The moon, which can be seen as a symbol of the unconscious and a guide through the darkness (both as opposed to the sun), is rendered with a contemplative and huge presence (big and sketch-like in black and then very small but bright and with clear lines inside that bigger half-moon shape). The lunar element speaks to the cycles of creativity and reflection, a celestial body that is both witness and participant in the artist’s nocturnal dialogues with himself and his works.</p><p>‘The Dot’, as described by omentejovem, represents an individual singularity, a focal point of identity and personal significance amid the vast canvas of existence. It can be found in multiple places in this piece, but most significantly on the right side, ‘alone’ in the off-white. ‘The Dot’ serves as a reminder to maintain one’s core in a (fast-paced) changing world, like a nexus of self amidst the swirling cosmos of potential and distraction.<br/>The interplay between the overarching presence of ‘The Moon’ and the grounding ‘The Dot’ creates a dichotomy within the artwork, symbolizing the balance between the vastness of the cosmos and the intimacy of individual existence. The dynamic between the two can be interpreted as a conversation about the macro and micro, the universal and the personal, the external world and the internal sphere.</p><p>In the context of omentejovem’s narrative, these symbols are not static; they are ever-evolving concepts that morph with each artistic iteration. They invite the viewer to contemplate their own place in the universe, their own ‘dots’, and how they interact with the larger forces at play—like the gravitational pull of the moon on the tides of human experience.</p><p>Down below there seems to be a big visual feast, as if figures are dancing in the moonlight. Among them, there’s one distinct character delineated in a contrasting hue and holding a heart-shaped balloon. Might this be an avatar for the artist? The balloon, an object of whimsy and ascent, might suggest the elevation of the artist’s aspirations and the lightness of dreams (The Moon) against the gravity of reality (The Dot). Combined, they speak of the artist’s love for his practice, a love that is not bound by the conventional hours but can easily flourish in the liberty of the night, hence the title ‘Late Night Love’.</p><p><span>Besides one’s own thoughts and interpretations, for omentejovem the stand-out figure with the balloon was created by means of encapsulating the transient nature of a brief romance the artist experienced while being on a trip to São Paulo. The piece is set in the thrall of the city’s vibrant nightlife and the ephemeral connections it fosters. The balloon in the shape of a heart, the latter a symbol of love in its myriad forms, here represents the artist’s contemplation of both affection and at the same time solitude within the fleeting intimacy of a short-lived relationship.</span></p><p>In its entirety, this work speaks to the interconnectedness of the individual and the collective, the artist and the audience. It is a reflection on omentejovem’s journey and an open invitation to the viewer to engage themselves in an (inner) dialogue, echoing the very nature of art as a medium of communication and connection.</p><h6>Words by Nina Knaack</h6></div></div><div class="flex flex-row gap-6 w-full max-w-sm xl:gap-24"><p class="socials font-heading text-xs min-w-[4.5rem] text-secondary-100 sm:text-base
